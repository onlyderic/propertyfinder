# propertyfinder
An old personal project for searching real estate properties using CodeIgniter and MySQL

# Disclaimer
This is a very old project that was created with an old version of CodeIgniter in the absence of sophisticated technologies. There are no unit tests created, but this was made carefully with passion. ;-) It's up to you to improve its security and performance as well.

# How To
1. Add CodeIgniter's sytem folder
2. Update config files
